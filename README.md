## About

`StrategicForces` contains comprehensive data on United States strategic nuclear forces between
1945 and 2023. In particular, it aims to illustrate changes in the composition of U.S. strategic force structure
by providing an illustrated breakdown of weapon deployments over time, including data on:

- Delivery vehicles for each leg of the nuclear triad (e.g. ICBM, SLBM, Bomber)

- Warheads associated with each weapons system in its respective triad leg

- Nuclear stockpile inventories, nuclear tests, arms control agreements

- Facilities of the nuclear weapons complex

The aim is to provide a user-friendly interface where those interested in nuclear weapons and nuclear policy
can learn more about the evolution of U.S. nuclear forces and arms control throughout the last eight decades.

## Notes

Counts on bomber deployments do not include dual capable aircraft (DCA).

Nonstrategic/tactical weapons are not included due to the ambiguity of "nonstrategic" as a weapons category. Data on deployed nonstrategic warheads per year is also sparse at best and difficult to obtain to reliable figures on.

Due to the lack of availability of data on specific warhead deployments, as well as inconsistencies in reporting on gravity bomb modifications, data on deployed gravity bombs only begins in 1998.
