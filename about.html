<p>The impact of nuclear weapons on international relations has been nothing short of revolutionary. Not only have they reshaped how we think about warfare, their existence has also permanently altered how states make political and strategic calculations. The end of the Cold War and its associated fears of arms races and nuclear war may have taken some of the spotlight off nuclear weapons, but thirty years onward, nuclear weapons continue to remain foundational to international security. This application aims to provide a tool where users can explore and visualise different aspects of nuclear weapons, from the evolution of U.S. strategic force structure to arms control, and from warhead stockpiles to the facilities that design and produce them.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h5>
<p>Click on a tab which you wish to explore. There, you’ll find a menu on the right-hand side with different sorts of data options which you can toggle to view different types of charts and tables. Once you’ve generated a chart you like, you can click on a point on the chart to get some information about the relevant line/point on the chart. There’s also tables included where you can view the raw data if you wish. Don’t be afraid to try out different filters and settings! There’s <em>a lot</em> of data here for you to mess around with.</p>
<p>If something isn’t working as it should, or there’s a new feature you’d like to suggest adding, don’t hesitate to reach out and let me know. I’d be interested to hear any suggestions you might have.</p>
<h5 id="notes">Notes</h5>
<p>As always, there are a few limitations which one should keep in mind when using this tool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Warhead counts are for <em>deployed</em> weapons only, and do not include warheads kept in reserve.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonstrategic/tactical weapons are not included due to the ambiguity of “nonstrategic” as a weapons category.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the lack of availability of data on specific warhead deployments, as well as inconsistencies in reporting on gravity bomb modifications, data on deployed gravity bombs only begins in 1998.</p></li>
</ul>
